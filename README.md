# Repository Info

This repository contains work done for my Data Structures & Algorithms Module Assignment 1 at SP
The scope of the assignment consisted of developing a command-line program with object-oriented design principles for a software that will
1. replace all occurrences of a word in a text from a predefined list of synonyms,
2. and replace all occurrences of the synonyms with the root word

i.e. "The quick and lazy brown fox jumped over the quick and lazy dog." <---> "The speedy and sluggish brown fox leaped over the fast and slothful canine."

- `classes` contains the python code for the classes developed for the program
- `data` contains the text files used to test the program
- `main.py` contains the main python program to run the command-line interface
